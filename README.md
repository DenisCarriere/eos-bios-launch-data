EOS BIOS Launch Data
====================

This is a proposed repository that holds information about the boot sequence and the Candidate Block Producers willing to participate in a (potential mainnet) network launch.

This repository relies on the
[`eos-bios`](https://github.com/eoscanada/eos-bios) software to
execute the launch of an `EOS.IO Software`-based blockchain.

Propose your candidacy by submitting a PR against `launch.yaml`, and
roll out your own `hooks` (see samples in `hooks/`) that match your
infrastructure.

Be ready to run `eos-bios` when the time comes.

We'll all want to practice a lot, so join us on the
[_EOSIO BIOS Boot_](https://t.me/joinchat/GSUv1UaI5QIuifHZs8k_eA)
channel on Telegram.


Data about the candidate producers
----------------------------------

Here is the required data for candidate producers to use this software:

```
producers:
- account_name: eos.freezing
  authority:
    owner:
      threshold: 1
      keys:
      - public_key: EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV
        weight: 1
    active:
      threshold: 1
      keys:
      - public_key: EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV
        weight: 1
  initial_block_signing_key: EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV
  keybase_user: frozenjack
  organization_name: EOS Antarctica
  timezone: Antarctica/South_Pole
  urls:
  - https://its.freezing.example.com
  - https://twitter/frozenjack
```

* `account_name`: the EOS Account name you want to boot the network with. It must follow the 12-characters limit and be composed of those characters only: `.12345abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`. The BIOS Boot node will create that account and set it up for you.
* `authority` is the authorized you want the Boot Node to register for you, first thing. By providing a potentially multi-sig authority here, you can avoid bootstrapping your multi-sig strategy after chain launch.
* `initial_block_signing_key` is the key used to register the 21 Appointed Block Producers. It will not be used otherwise, but you must be ready to produce with this key if you are chosen in the 21 ABPs.
* `keybase_user` is used for PGP signing of kickstart data. It needs to be accessible by the person doing the boot sequence with the launch alliance. It is not needed after the boot process.
* `organization_name` is a friendly name for people to identify you.
* `timezone` is a standard Timezone spec (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones in the TZ column). Please select a non-deprecated time zone.  This is going to be used to help choose a good boot time and help locate geographically the producers.
* `urls` is a list of web properties owned by the organization. Those properties will be watched during the boot sequence, as a BIOS boot node would need to publish the _kickstart data_ to some (or all) of these properties.


Installing `eos-bios`
---------------------

Head to https://github.com/eoscanada/eos-bios/releases to get binary releases
of the software, for Windows, Mac and Linux.


The process
-----------

Once you have crafted your configuration (by copying all the
`sample_*` files and customizing them), you can run:

    eos-bios --launch-data launch.yaml --local-config config.yaml

and watch the network boot.

You can run this binary from any location (a server, your laptop,
whatever), provided the hooks can manipulate your infrastructure
(through some config management, ssh, orchestrators, etc..)







-----------

TODO:

* Do the verification..
  * Make the process into a .yaml file, all plugin-based, sort of...

* Onboard people to `launch.yaml`
