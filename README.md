EOS BIOS Producer data
======================

This is the data repository for candidate Block Producers willing to
use [`eos-bios`](https://github.com/eoscanada/eos-bios) to bootstrap an
`EOS.IO Software` blockchain.

Propose your candidacy by submitting a PR to this repository, adding
your information to `launch.yaml`.

Be ready to run `eos-bios` when the time comes.

You'll need practice, so we'll be on the _EOS.IO Community Testnet_
channel on Telegram, rehearsing many times before launch.
